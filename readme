I uploaded a few examples of python background themes whose I found on different sites, so I hope you guys like it.


1. Close IDLE if open.
2. Go to search menu and type '/.idlerc' if u don't find it go to your /C: drive/users and search again.
3. Create cfg document 'config-highlight.cfg' and paste in one of your favorite background theme.
4. Copy cfg file in /.idlerc directory.
5. Open IDLE and go to: options -> configure IDLE -> Highlighting and click on 'a Custom Theme'
6. If you don't like theme just change it or make your own with Hex RGB codes 'http://www.tayloredmktg.com/rgb/'
